# cl-tic-tac-toe

Make a command line tic-tac-toe game from scratch for two players. 
Expected features
===============
* Minimal UI that redraws the board and makes clear whose turn it is, each turn.
* Players can submit moves (assume, admittedly unrealistically, that both players are sitting at the same keyboard).
* Win detection - detect and display who won
